## Commit guidelines

This project *strictly* follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
Check out [their explanation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) in case you're not familiar with it.

Since this project's scope is rather small, we only use types to categorize our commits:

* `feat` - A new feature.
* `chore` - A small task that doesn't add any new features or fix any bugs.
* `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
* `fix` - A bug fix.
* `docs` - Documentation only changes.

## Adding support for a new language

To add support for a new language, you need to do the following:

1. Add a new file under [`src/i18n/locales`](../src/i18n/locales) with the language code as the filename (e.g. `en.json`). 
2. Import the file from step 1. in [`src/i18n/index.ts`](../src/i18n/index.ts) and add it to the `messages` constant.

## Adding support for a new currency

To add support for a new currency, you need to do the following:

1. Add your currency code to [src/store/state/types.ts](../src/store/state/types.ts) to the `availableCurrencies` array.

## Adding a new feature

If you want to add a new feature, make sure to [create an issue](https://github.com/simonwep/ocular/issues/new/choose) first to discuss it, so we can make sure it fits the project's scope.
I appreciate every contribution, but I want to keep the project focused on its main goal.
